# Australian Government — Architecture Governance

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern technology projects for the **Australian Government**.

## Background

The Australian Government is undertaking significant digital transformation across its agencies and departments. With initiatives spanning Services Australia (myGov, Centrelink, Medicare), the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), and the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), there is a growing need for structured architecture governance to ensure technology investments align with whole-of-government strategies, security requirements, and citizen service outcomes.
